Introducing the Library Management System: This project makes borrowing books easier for students. They can create accounts, borrow, and return books hassle-free. No more waiting in queues. Administrators can effortlessly update the database and add new titles.

* The user interface (UI) is developed with a combination of HTML, CSS, JSP, and Bootstrap. Each page is crafted to offer an attractive and user-friendly experience.

* Leveraging an Oracle SQL database, the project effectively manages data storage. JDBC facilitates seamless database connectivity, while specialized DAO (Data Access Object) classes efficiently retrieve data from the database.

* Key Features:

1) Admin Empowerment: The system ensures secure admin registration and login, bolstered by validation. Admins possess the authority to modify credentials and passwords via the admin dashboard.

2) Effortless Book Control: Administrators seamlessly manage books by adding or removing them, adjusting prices, managing quantities, and maintaining comprehensive student data.

3) Student Convenience: Students easily register and log in, with the option to update credentials and passwords as needed.

4) Efficient Book Issuance: Students borrow books across categories, facilitated by payment. The system generates detailed bills for issued books.

5) Borrowing History: Students monitor borrowing history, tracking issue and return dates directly from the database.

6) Strong Validations and Exception handling: The project features thorough validation for usernames and passwords, providing a robust layer of protection. It adeptly manages errors, addressing both user inputs and system exceptions effectively.

These key features, coupled with simplified book returns and a mechanism for managing late returns, enrich the Library Management System, enhancing user experience for both administrators and students.
